About
-----

Niner Nav is an Android tool to help students and visitors navigate the University of North Carolina at Charlotte campus by tracking your location via GPS.

You can navigate to a building by searching the name from the map, or by going to the Navigation page and filling out the From and To fields.

Once in navigation mode, the application will draw the quickest walking path to your destination, which you can then use to get to your desired place on campus.


`Note:` Niner Nav is designed to only show your location within campus bounds. If you are not currently on the UNCC campus, you can only browse the map, or show the walking path from one building to another, using the 'Navigation' screen.


Installation
-------------

In order to get Niner Nav running, please run the following command in a terminal...
